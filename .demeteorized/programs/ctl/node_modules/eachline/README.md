Streams2 line reader / stream transformer.

First let me say: I did **NOT** want to write yet another line reader! 
I couldn't find one that is working with node's new `Streams2` objects.

The [byline](https://github.com/jahewson/node-byline) module has taken a first stab at it, 
but it isn't working. (as of [32bf791e38](https://github.com/jahewson/node-byline/commit/32bf791e387a46c720b604d8d5807eeb8f668ddf))

**So here we are...**
```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var eachline = require('eachline');
var stream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname+'/.gitignore');

eachline(stream, function(line){
  console.log(line);
});
```

However, if you're just looking to open a file:
```javascript
var eachline = require('eachline');
eachline.in(__dirname+'/.gitignore', function(line){
  console.log(line);
});
```

...or if you need a simple http GET:
```javascript
var eachline = require('eachline');
var url = 'https://raw.github.com/williamwicks/node-eachline/master/.gitignore';
eachline.in(url, function(line){
  console.log(line);
});
```

##Transforming Streams
[eachline](https://github.com/williamwicks/node-eachline) uses `Streams2`'s transformation 
feature allowing you to throw [eachline](https://github.com/williamwicks/node-eachline) between `.pipe()`s
to modify output as needed.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var eachline = require('eachline');
var file = fs.createReadStream(__dirname+'/.gitignore');

var transformer = eachline(function(data){
  return data.substr(0, 2)+'\n';
});

file.pipe(transformer).pipe(process.stdout);
```

##API
###eachline([encoding,] callback)
Use with `pipe()` optionally specifying the encoding.

###eachline(ReadableStream,[ encoding,] callback)
Got that stream ready? Pass it in, get them lines. Easy-peasy.

###eachline.in(url, callback)<br>
eachline.in(filepath, callback)
Just a helper function to make these simple tasks cleaner.

It returns the `Transform` stream so you can listen to the events.
```javascript
var linecount = 0;
var eachline = require('eachline');
eachline.in(__dirname+'/.gitignore', function(data){
	linecount++;
})
.on('finish', function(){
	console.log(linecount + " lines found");
});
```

**callback(data, lineno[ ,next])**<BR>
The `callback` arguments above will be called for every line found in the `ReadableStream`.

It will be passed the `data` and `lineno` arguments. You can optionally defined a
3rd argument to get asynchronous flow. `eachline` examines `callback.length` to detirmine
if asynchronous flow should be used. If found, you must call `next()` to continue reading.

For Stream transformations, any value `return`'d will be written to the next `pipe()` in the chain.
