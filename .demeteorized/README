This is a Meteor application bundle. It has only one dependency:
Node.js 0.10 (with the 'fibers' package). The current release of Meteor
has been tested with Node 0.10.21. To run the application:

  $ rm -r programs/server/node_modules/fibers
  $ npm install fibers@1.0.1
  $ export MONGO_URL='mongodb://user:password@host:port/databasename'
  $ export ROOT_URL='http://example.com'
  $ export MAIL_URL='smtp://user:password@mailhost:port/'
  $ node main.js

Use the PORT environment variable to set the port where the
application will listen. The default is 80, but that will require
root on most systems.
