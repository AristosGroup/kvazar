[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AristosGroup/kvazar.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AristosGroup/kvazar)

Kvazar is an open-source Next generation Issue Tracker built with Meteor.


  
  Never mind that I rarely commits!
  I am developing a few packages in another application, and these packets will be transferred to  Kvazar in the near future.
